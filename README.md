# Udacity_Cpp_Project_and_Exercise
Practiced OOP, memory management and concurrency in C++ through completing 5 projects and numerous exercise

# Projects

1 - Route Planner: Used OpenStreetMap data and the IO2D visualization library to build a route planner that finds a path between two points on a real-world map.

2 - Process Monitor: Wrote object-oriented C++ to build a Linux system monitor similar to the widely used htop application.

3 - Memory Management Chatbot: Optimized existing chatbot code using modern C++ memory management techniques such as smart pointers and move semantics.

4 - Concurrent Traffic Simulation: Built a multithreaded traffic simulator using a real urban map. Run each vehicle on a separate thread, and manage intersections to facilitate traffic flow and avoid collisions.

5 - Capstone Project: Final capstone project for the program.
